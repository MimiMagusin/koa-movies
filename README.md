# koa-movies

I created a small restful API (with all basic CRUD actions) after the tutorial on [mherman.org](http://mherman.org/blog/2017/08/23/building-a-restful-api-with-koa-and-postgres/#.Wi5ecUpSzVp)

It is created TDD, with koa, knex and postgresql.


# Set Up

This is pure Reading at the moment, as you would have to set up a postgres account and change the link in the conneciton file. I might add a comment later.
